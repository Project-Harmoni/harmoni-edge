# Harmoni Edge Functions (and Database Schemas)

## Introduction
This repository contains all the Supabase Edge functions. 
These include functions to simplify iOS requests to the 
Supabase database and storage, as well as Edge functions to 
coordinate between the database and Web 3.

This repository also contains the schemas and SQL code for 
setting up Supabase's relational database, including tables
and database functions.

## Quick-Start Resources

- Supabase - https://supabase.com/
- Edge functions - https://supabase.com/edge-functions
- TypeScript - https://www.typescriptlang.org/

## Repository Structure

This repository follows the structure autogenerated
by the Supabase development environment (see next section).
Key components of this repository include:

- Configuration - supabase/config.toml
- Edge functions - supabase/functions/
- Seed data - supabase/seed.sql
- SQL tables/schemas - supabase/migrations/
- Tests - supabase/tests/


## Supabase Development Environment

Supabase offers a local development environment via containers,
as well as guidance for a workflow to deploy from this dev
environment to a non-local project.

To set up your machine, follow the instructions here:

https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started

The key setup steps are:
- Install Docker Desktop (or equivalent) to support containers
- Install Supabase CLI
- From this folder, run "supabase start" to spin up
- Run "supabase db reset" to apply migrations and seed data changes

The reset should run all the existing SQL migration code, seed.sql, etc.
SQL migration code is used to create and modify the data tables.
The seed.sql file can instantiate data in those tables locally,
which is useful for running tests.

Once the dev environment is spun up, the CLI will list several URLs:

- API URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321
- GraphQL URL: http://127.0.0.1:54321/graphql/v1
- DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres
- Studio URL: http://127.0.0.1:54323
- Inbucket URL: http://127.0.0.1:54324

Along with some secrets and tokens.

The Studio URL (http://127.0.0.1:54323) will bring you to the Dashboard
where you can explore and manually manipulate the tables and data.

## Online Project Deployment
To serve Harmoni’s other components and fully test its functionality, 
you will need an online Supabase project.
You can create an online test environment for free.
Access https://supabase.com/ and click “Start Your Project.”

After creating the project, access the project dashboard:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/(your-project-key)
Under Storage, create two public buckets called "images" and "music".

Alternatively, if you have been granted team credentials,
an online test environment exists and is accessible for Harmoni at:

https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jfnwxnzeswkzvsudcgew

The final piece in the URL is the project key.


The suggested workflow is as follows:
- Create a new migration and check its effects locally
- Push to the online environment
- If all looks good, commit to git repo

To push local dev-stage changes to the online project,
first log in from the terminal via

supabase login

Link the project to your local dev environment:

supabase link --project-ref jfnwxnzeswkzvsudcgew

Login requires the database password. You should already
have it or be able to reset it via the Supabase dashboard
(see Settings > Database).

Note as well that the CLI may report this:
"Local config differs from linked project. Try updating supabase/config.toml"

This is expected. You can ignore it.

Then push database migrations to the non-local project via

supabase db push

And deploy edge functions via

supabase functions deploy function-name-here

Note: you will need to run “functions deploy” multiple times, once for each edge function. Each subfolder in harmoni-edge/supabase/functions/ is a function name.

The push is for migrations (structure and database function changes)
and does not include seed data.
This avoids unintentional changes to the online test data.

For further details, see the "Deploy your project" section 
in the local development guide:
https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development

Note: some of Supabase's documentation discusses creating a new git repo 
and config.toml, but this is not needed to deploy a pre-existing codebase.

## Security Advisory
Project Harmoni in its current state provides a functional backbone.
For a secure production, this project will require changes to support
Supabase's row-level security and private buckets.
